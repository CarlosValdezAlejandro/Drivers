# Development of the ADS1115 driver for STM32Cube IDE
This repository contains the source code for the ADS1115 driver developed for the STM32Cube IDE platform, which uses the HAL drivers. The code is fully commented for ease of understanding and modification.

## About the driver
The ADS1115 driver is designed to be used with the STM32Cube IDE platform and other STM32 microcontrollers. The driver's purpose is to enable communication with the 16-bit ADS1115 ADC via the I2C protocol.

## How to use the driver
To use the driver, simply download the source code and copy it into your STM32Cube IDE project. The source code is divided into different files to facilitate use and modification.

The driver is designed to be easy to use and modify. If you have any suggestions for improvement or comments, please let me know. I am open to feedback to continue improving the driver.

## Development status
The ADS1115 driver for STM32Cube IDE is in its initial version, and there are still some features that are in development. At present, the driver is capable of communicating with the ADS1115 via the I2C protocol. However, work is being done to improve the driver's functionality to make it even more useful.
